            Investing in land back home is a powerful step towards building a
            legacy and securing a future. However, for the Kenyan diaspora, the
            physical distance can create unique challenges. Without a trusted
            presence on the ground, buyers can easily fall victim to
            misinformation, fraudulent deals, or simply make a poor investment
            choice. This article will highlight the top five common mistakes
            made by diaspora buyers and provide practical advice on how to avoid
            them, ensuring your investment in Uasin Gishu is both safe and
            profitable.

              The single biggest mistake is failing to perform thorough due
              diligence. This includes verifying the title deed, checking for
              any encumbrances or disputes, and confirming the seller's
              identity. Many diaspora buyers rely solely on family or friends,
              who may not have the expertise to spot red flags. This can lead to
              purchasing a property that has multiple owners, is subject to a
              court case, or is not even legally registered.

              It's tempting to use a relative or a friend of a friend to "save
              on agency fees." While this may seem like a good idea, it often
              leads to a lack of accountability and expertise. Unlicensed
              brokers or unofficial intermediaries may not be familiar with the
              legal processes, leading to delays, missing paperwork, or
              worse‚Äîlosing your money. A professional real estate agent is bound
              by a code of ethics and has the legal backing to ensure a smooth

              A beautiful piece of land might not be suitable for your intended
              use. Eldoret and Uasin Gishu County have specific zoning and land
              use policies. Buying a plot intended for agriculture and trying to
              build a residential home on it can lead to legal issues, fines,
              and even demolition. Many buyers fail to check these policies,
              only to realize later that their dreams of building a specific
              type of property are not possible.

              The advertised price of a property is rarely the final cost.
              Diaspora buyers often overlook additional expenses such as legal
              fees, stamp duty, transfer fees, and professional fees for
              surveyors. These costs can add up to a significant amount,
              catching buyers off guard and straining their budgets. A

              financial planning from the start.

              The excitement of buying a property can lead to rushing the
              process, especially when a "deal" seems too good to be true. A
              hurried transaction often means skipping crucial steps like site
              verification, legal checks, or reviewing the contract thoroughly.
              This haste is a primary reason why many diaspora investors end up
              in legal battles or with a property that doesn't meet their
              expectations. Patience and a systematic approach are key to a
              successful investment.
