              This is arguably the most common and devastating scam. A fraudster
              creates a counterfeit title deed that looks authentic. They might
              even impersonate the real landowner using fake identification.
              They will push for a quick transaction, often offering the land at
              a "bargain" price to rush you into a decision. The buyer pays,
              receives the fake document, and later discovers they have no legal
              claim to the property.

              Some fraudulent sellers will sell the same piece of land to
              multiple unsuspecting buyers. This often happens with land that is
              under family ownership, where one member sells the property
              without the consent of the others. These cases often result in
              prolonged and expensive court battles, with the original buyer's
              money trapped in legal limbo.

              Land can be subject to various legal claims, or "encumbrances."
              This could be a bank loan (a charge), a court order, or a caveat.
              A land search will reveal these issues. Some sellers might try to
              convince you to buy land with a charge, promising to clear the
              loan with your money. This is a high-risk gamble that can lead to
              you losing both the land and your money if the seller defaults.

                <strong>Caveats:</strong> This means a third party has made a

              Beyond the specific scams, there are general warning signs that
              should trigger your alarm bells. A seller who insists on a
              cash-only transaction, refuses to use an official legal

              to avoid. Trust your gutâ€”if something feels off, it probably is.

                <strong>Cash-Only Deals:</strong> Avoid any seller who demands

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Official Professionals:</strong> Refusal to involve

              <li>

              <li>
